# Basics of Strings
print "Hello Class!"
 print "Error"
"This is a string" #A string is denoted by a set of double quotes
'This is also a string' #Strings can also be defined with single quotes

print "Hello " + "Class!" # + concatenates two strings
print "Welcome "*3 # *n copies the string n times

# Goal of being able to write a Lortenzian function

# y(x) = 1/pi * A * (0.5*Gam)/((x-x0)^2 + (0.5*Gam)^2)

# What are the parameters


# Get pi for the lorentz function


# What point do we want to calculate?


# Calculate the value of that function at that point.


# Store values in a list


# For loop examples to add multiple values to lor


# Integration


# Check the accuracy of the lorentz approx with conditionals
