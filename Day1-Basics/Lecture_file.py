print "Hello Class!"
print "Error"
"This is a string" #A string is denoted by a set of double quotes
'This is also a string' #Strings can also be defined with single quotes

print "Hello " + "Class!" # + concatenates two strings
print "Welcome "*3 # *n copies the string n times

# Goal of being able to write a Lortenzian function

# y(x) = 1/pi * A * (0.5*Gam)/((x-x0)^2 + (0.5*Gam)^2)

# What are the parameters
x0  = 2
Gam = 1
A   = 1



# Make Calculation Easier make 1/2 Gam the param gam2

# Get pi

# Find for a point

# Basic list storage

# Store to a list

# Define Function?

# Do multiple times

# Integration Check
