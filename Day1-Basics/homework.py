# Problem 1: Use the string manipulations to replace Name with any Name
s = "Hello Name I hope you are having a great day!"

# Problem 2: Replace the strings in the following list with the approriate numbers, Remove all non number string elements
l = [0, 1, 2, "3", "4", 5, 6, "Cats", 7, '8', 9, "puppy"]

# Problem 3: Using what you learened from the Lorentz storage and functions, make multiple functions that will generate a list of Lorentz function values for a set of upper and lower bounds, and check if that approx is good

#Problem 4: Finish bonus task 4 in SimpleDataAnalysis.py. Using for loops and if/else statements, identify the min and max of the UV region for the data set in SimpleDataAnalysis.py 

#Problem 5: Finish bonus task 5 in SimpleDataAnalysis.py. Convert your approach for task 4 into a function FindEnergyBounds() in the file HelperFunctions.py.  Use that function and the data below to identify the max for that region.

#Problem 6: Write a function that integrates under the curve of the values stored in data in SimpleDataAnalysis.py.  Hint: start by using rectangular integration.
